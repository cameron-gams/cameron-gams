### Hi, my name is Cameron. I'm currently a junior at [https://www.wku.edu/academy/](The Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky)!
(by extension, this also makes me a freshman at [wku.edu](Western Kentucky University))

- I'm currently learning CUDA
- I'm working with Dr. Ivan Novikov in the [https://www.wku.edu/physics/](WKU Department of Physics & Astronomy)
- My pronouns are he/him/his (but I'm fine with any)
